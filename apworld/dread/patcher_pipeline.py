"""Patcher pipeline glue — bundled inside the apworld so /patch works
from a deployed .apworld zip (no scripts/ needed).

Two pure functions that mirror the historic CLI scripts:

  * :func:`placements_to_overrides` — was ``scripts/seed_to_patcher_overrides.py``.
  * :func:`merge_overrides` — was ``scripts/build_patcher_json.py``.

The :func:`patch` orchestration runs both in sequence and invokes the
upstream ``open-dread-rando`` CLI to write the modded romfs. It's the
implementation behind the in-client ``/patch`` command.

The CLI scripts under ``scripts/`` are thin wrappers around this module
— single source of truth for the conversion logic.

The Switch→PC collected-checks path needs no init.lc patching: it is
handled entirely by the client-sent Randovania bootstrap
(``client/bootstrap.py`` → ``RL.GetCollectedIndicesAndSend``), which
reads the authoritative Blackboard ``Location_Collected_*`` props and
pushes the COLLECTED_INDICES bitfield. (An earlier design injected an
equivalent Lua block into ``init.lc``; that was removed as redundant
once the bootstrap shipped — see docs/wire-wiring-notes.md.)

# ---- Switch save-profile name budget --------------------------------
#
# DORMANT since ``split_saves`` was turned OFF in the starter preset (see
# SPLIT_SAVES below): with it off, ``patch_saveslot`` early-returns, no
# ``rom:/RDVHASH`` is written, and no save entry is ever named from these
# fields. The budget + guard are KEPT because they are the only record of a
# hardware-only failure mode, and they re-arm the moment anyone flips
# ``split_saves`` back on. The text below describes that enabled behavior.
#
# open-dread-rando (patch_saveslot) writes ``rom:/RDVHASH`` =
# ``RDV_{configuration_identifier}_{layout_uuid}`` and the exlaunch
# sysmodule (romfs.cpp setSeedSaveProfile) renames the game's three save
# profiles to ``{RDVHASH}_0`` / ``_1`` / ``_2``. That string becomes a
# Nintendo save-data filesystem ENTRY NAME, which is capped at 64 bytes on
# real hardware. Ryujinx maps saves onto the host filesystem, so an
# over-long name only fails on a real Switch — save creation errors at
# new-game. (This bit once: the identifier used to embed the AP slot name,
# pushing the entry to ~71 bytes for a 16-char slot; the slot component was
# removed because layout_uuid — sha256(seed_id:slot_name) — already makes
# the name unique per (seed, slot).) The same two config fields also feed
# ``Init.sThisRandoIdentifier`` in custom_init.lua, so the save key and the
# in-game "different Randomizer mod" cross-check can never drift from each
# other — but changing either field for an EXISTING seed orphans in-progress
# saves, so the guard below must stay a fail-fast on NEW generations, never
# a silent rewrite of the identifier.

# ---- split_saves: deliberately OFF ----------------------------------
#
# ``cosmetic_patches.split_saves`` gives each seed its own save profiles.
# open-dread-rando's own schema defaults it to False; our starter preset used
# to force it True. It is now False, matching upstream's default.
#
# WHY OFF: turning it on is what arms the exlaunch sysmodule's
# ``setSeedSaveProfile`` (romfs.cpp), which runs from the ``nn::fs::MountRom``
# hook on every boot and OVERWRITES three entries of the game's static CStrId
# bank in place::
#
#     const int STRINGBANK_PROFILE0 = 917;   // romfs.hpp — NOT version-gated
#     offsets->StaticStringBank = 0x1d552d0; // main.cpp  — IS version-gated
#
# The bank BASE is selected per game version; the INDEX 917 is a single
# hardcoded constant shared across 1.0.0-2.1.0. If the bank ("a large array of
# common CStrId in alpha order") shifted by even one entry between builds, that
# write lands on the wrong string — a silent memory corruption at boot whose
# first consumer is the main menu's save-slot list. That is the shape of the
# deterministic ``strlen(NULL)`` crash-on-title we chased (Atmosphere report,
# MainThread, pure cazadora.nss frames, PC client not even running).
#
# WHAT WE GIVE UP: nothing load-bearing. Cross-seed save protection does NOT
# come from split_saves — ``custom_scenario.lua`` patches
# ``Scenario.InitScenario`` to cross-check the save's ``THIS_RANDO_IDENTIFIER``
# blackboard prop against ``Init.sThisRandoIdentifier`` and hard-refuses a
# foreign save with a fatal-error screen ("DO NOT save over their game!"),
# independently of this flag. What we lose is only the convenience of separate
# per-seed slots: rando saves now share the vanilla ``profile0/1/2`` slots, so a
# new seed's save can occupy a slot a previous seed (or a vanilla playthrough)
# was using. The InitScenario guard means a mismatched save cannot be entered or
# written over silently — it is refused at load.

    """End-to-end /patch implementation. Pure-ish (writes to disk, runs
    a subprocess) — returns a PatchResult that the caller surfaces as
    log output.

    Steps:
      1. dependency check
      2. build patcher_input.json from `placements`
      3. invoke `python -m open_dread_rando` against the vanilla romfs,
         writing the mod into `dreadvania_install_dir` (overwriting in place)
      4. re-assert ``exefs_overlay`` (our patched sysmodule files) over the
         exefs the patcher just wrote — see below.

    ``dreadvania_install_dir`` is the FINAL mod folder (the dir whose
    ``romfs``/``exefs`` the game loads). ``mod_compatibility`` selects the
    patcher's on-disk layout (``open_dread_rando/output_config.py``):

      - ``"ryujinx"`` appends a ``DreadRandovania`` segment to
        ``--output-path``; the install dir already ends in that segment, so
        we hand the patcher the PARENT and let it re-create the leaf. (Passing
        the dir directly produced ``.../DreadRandovania/DreadRandovania`` and,
        worse, the nested ``exefs`` got the patcher's bundled UPSTREAM
        (server-mode, port 6969) ``subsdk9`` — "Multiple replacements to
        subsdk9".)
      - ``"atmosphere"`` appends ``contents/<tid>`` instead, and a real Switch
        only reads ``exefs``/``romfs`` directly under that title folder — NOT
        a ``DreadRandovania`` subfolder. So an SD/custom deploy MUST run in
        this mode; running it in ``"ryujinx"`` mode strands the seed in
        ``contents/<tid>/DreadRandovania/`` where the console ignores it (the
        bug this parameter fixes). The caller derives the mode from the deploy
        target (Ryujinx → ``"ryujinx"``; SD/custom → ``"atmosphere"``).

    :func:`_resolve_output_layout` inverts the upstream path math for the
    chosen mode so the mod lands AT ``dreadvania_install_dir`` either way.

    ``exefs_overlay`` (name→source-path, e.g. our built ``subsdk9`` +
    ``main.npdm``) is copied into the final mod's ``exefs`` AFTER the patcher
    runs. The patcher always writes its own upstream ``subsdk9`` there, so
    without this re-assert our patched sysmodule would be clobbered on every
    patch and the Switch would fall back to listening on 6969.

    We also always re-assert open-dread-rando's exefs version-sentinel IPS
    patches (``Game.HasRandomizerPatches``) via :func:`_install_exefs_ips` —
    the vendored open-dread-rando submodule omits them and ``rmtree``s the
    exefs dir each run, so without this the game rejects every save as an
    "Unsupported Metroid Dread version". These land in the per-mode
    exefs-patches dir (alongside ``exefs`` for Ryujinx; the GLOBAL
    ``exefs_patches/DreadRandovania`` tree for Atmosphere, since a real Switch
    reads IPS from there, not from inside the title folder). See that helper
    for the full why.

    The Switch→PC collected-checks wiring lives in the client-sent
    Randovania bootstrap, so no post-patch init.lc edit is needed.
