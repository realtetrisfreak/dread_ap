    ``RL.ReceivePickup(msg, cls, progression_string, receivedPickupIndex,

    pending AND ``receivedPickupIndex == RL.ReceivedPickups()`` and
    ``inventoryIndex == RL.InventoryIndex()`` — the exact-index match dedups
    duplicate/out-of-order sends. It then defers the grant through any cutscene
    (``RL.GivePendingPickup`` reschedules until ``Scenario.IsUserInteractionEnabled``)
    and, on confirm, calls ``cls.OnPickedUp`` then bumps ``ReceivedPickups``.

    So the caller delivers the AP item at position ``received_pickup_index ==
    game's ReceivedPickups`` tagged with the game's current ``inventory_index``;
    the counter advancing (next push) clocks the next delivery. This replaces
    the old ``OnPickedUp``-direct path, which moved ``InventoryIndex`` but never
    ``ReceivedPickups`` (so it was non-idempotent and could drop a mid-cutscene
    grant). See CLAUDE.md risk #1 and [[dread-delivery-protocol]].

    ``progression`` is a list of stages; each stage a list of resource dicts
    ``{"item_id": "ITEM_X", "quantity": N}``. ``cls`` is the Lua pickup class

    resources, while per-item classes do the input-toggle / weapon setup

    items the caller sends the FULL multi-stage progression with the first
    tier's class — the game's ``HandlePickupResources`` grants the next missing
    stage, so the same progression is re-sent on every delivery (see

    ``popup_seconds`` / ``reschedule_seconds`` are optional overrides for the
    on-Switch popup display duration and the delay before the bootstrap clears
    ``PendingPickup`` and re-sends its counters (which clocks the *next*
    delivery). Omitting both keeps the bootstrap's lone-item defaults

# Warping out of a boss arena with ``Game.LoadScenario`` corrupts the encounter:
# the arena's intro / door-lock / checkpoint state half-commits, so the fight
# can't be re-entered or reset cleanly. A user hit exactly this with Kraid —
# after a mid-fight /warp the fight couldn't be re-entered the normal way, broke
# when entered from the exit, and bricked the game on the death-respawn. So
# /warp is BLOCKED while Samus's current subarea (collision camera) is a
# boss-fight room. The engine exposes no getter for the live collision camera,
# but fires ``Scenario.OnSubAreaChange`` on every transition — ``lua/warp_guard.lua``
# wraps it to record the live scenario+subarea, and the warp src calls
# ``RL.IsInBossArena()`` before firing.
#
# Keys are scenario ids; each maps a collision-camera id (the same id the engine
# passes to ``OnSubAreaChange`` and that the patcher's camera-names dict keys on)
# to its human room name. Only the key set is load-bearing — the name is a
# comment for reviewers. Curated from the published room-name table. EMMI zones
# are deliberately EXCLUDED: you can run from an EMMI and a /warp there is
# legitimate softlock recovery, not a corrupting mid-fight bail. Only set-piece
