"""DreadContext — CommonContext subclass owning AP + Switch bridge.

Lifecycle inversion (vs the old code): the Switch is now the TCP dialer.
We host a TCP server on ``0.0.0.0:17777`` + a UDP discovery responder on
``0.0.0.0:17776``. Bridge fires :meth:`_on_switch_ready` when a Switch
HELLOs and becomes active; that callback sends the ``RL.*`` bootstrap
and starts the poll loop. On Switch disconnect the bridge either auto-
promotes an inactive Switch (re-firing :meth:`_on_switch_ready`) or
fires :meth:`_on_switch_gone` to stop the poll loop.

The :meth:`_attempt_delivery` semantics are unchanged — we still compose
``RL.ReceivePickup`` Lua and ship it via ``bridge.run_lua``; the only
difference is the wire format on the way.

        (Lua expressions — ``Init.sStarting*`` for start, quoted literals for a
        region) and rewind whatever the reload reverts.

        Same ``Game.LoadScenario`` primitive Randovania exposes via ZL+ZR at a
        save station (custom_scenario.lua:CheckWarpToStart). The crucial
        difference: upstream only fires it AT a save station, where state was
        just committed, so nothing is lost. Our ``/warp`` fires from anywhere —
        and ``Game.LoadScenario`` reloads Samus from the last SAVE (it is NOT
        checkpoint-continuous like a door transition), so every pickup collected
        since the last save reverts. Remote AP items self-heal (their
        ``ReceivedPickups`` cursor reverts too, so ``_attempt_delivery`` re-sends
        them), but the player's OWN seed-baked pickups are granted locally and
        AP never re-delivers them — so without a rewind they're lost for good
        (the reported missing-Energy-Tank bug). So we snapshot inventory + the
        delivery cursor before the warp and re-grant whatever reverted once the
        reload settles (see :meth:`_restore_after_warp`). The diff makes this a
        no-op for anything that did NOT revert.

        Gated client-side on (a) bridge connected + bootstrap done, and
        in-Lua on (b) ``Game.GetCurrentGameModeID() == "INGAME"``,
        (c) ``not RL.IsInBossArena()`` — refusing to warp out of a boss arena,
        which corrupts the encounter (the Kraid brick: re-entry breaks the
        fight, death-respawn bricks the game) — (c2) ``not RL.IsInNavRoom()``,
        (c3) ``not RL.IsInSaveRoom()`` and (c4) ``not RL.IsInMapRoom()`` —
        refusing to warp out of a Navigation (Adam) room, a save station, or a
        map station, where the conversation / save dialog / map overlay survives
        the reload and strands an undismissable box (these collision-camera
        detections live in ``lua/warp_guard.lua``) — (c5)
        ``not RL.IsInFlipperTrap()`` — refusing to warp out of the Ghavoran
        Flipper Room / Spider Magnet Elevator, where a mis-turned one-way flipper
        sticks the area and a warp only preserves the broken flip (the fix is a
        checkpoint reload, so we direct the player there) — and (d)
        ``Scenario.IsUserInteractionEnabled(true)``, so a /warp issued from the
        title screen, a boss fight, a Nav/save room, or mid-cutscene returns a
        human-readable "blocked" reason instead of firing into invalid state.
