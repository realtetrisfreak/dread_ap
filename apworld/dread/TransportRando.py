"""Transporter/elevator rando for the native-graph logic.

Shuffles where each elevator/shuttle ride arrives, as a TWO-WAY matching: if the
transport at endpoint X now reaches Y, then Y's transport reaches X. Shuffling is
WITHIN type (elevator<->elevator, shuttle<->shuttle) so the patcher always has a
compatible target spawn point. Teleporters are left vanilla (open-dread-rando's
elevator patcher only fully supports the TRANSPORT type — elevators/shuttles).

The matching feeds two consumers:
  * logic — ``graph_logic.build_regions`` adds the ride edges from the matching,
    so AP's live sweep re-derives reachability for this seed.
  * patcher — ``matching_to_elevators`` emits the open-dread-rando ``elevators``
    config (source actor -> destination scenario + target spawn point).

Like door rando this re-rolls until the matching doesn't strand any pickup that
was reachable under vanilla transports (a random matching can otherwise cut off a
transport-only region); that no-regression matching plus the door start-guard
keeps fill bootstrappable.

# NOTE on the Hanubia<->Itorash capsule rides (``capsulelaunchershipyard``
# up-launch + ``capsuleelevatorskybase`` post-Raven-Beak escape, USABLE component
# ``CCapsuleUsableComponent``): these WERE excluded from the shuffle pool after a
# game-side strlen(NULL) crash (cazadora.nss) at the Hanubia entrances /
# post-Raven-Beak was attributed to a shuffled capsule. That attribution was
# FALSIFIED (July 2026): the identical crash signature reproduced on a seed with
# transport AND door rando fully disabled (``elevators: []``), so the crash is a
# separate Hanubia-arrival bug, not the capsule shuffle. The exclusion has been
# reverted per the project owner's direction. Capsules are typed ``elevator`` by
# the extractor, so they shuffle in the GENERAL elevator pool — exactly matching
# Randovania, whose teleporter GUI lists every transporter (capsules included) as
# a shuffled-by-default checkbox with NO capsule special-casing, and whose
# ``all_settings`` patch-data fixture shuffles both capsules into ordinary
# elevator destinations with the same ``elevators`` entry shape we emit.
# OPEN VALIDATION ITEM: the post-Raven-Beak escape ride has never been
# play-verified in-game with a SHUFFLED escape capsule (neither by us nor,
# verifiably, by Randovania) — if the escape breaks, this is the first suspect.

    (e.g. the all-tricks-disabled starter preset leaves 8 Speedbooster-gated
    pickups unreachable — they hold filler under ``accessibility: minimal``).
    Requiring full reachability there would reject every roll and silently fall
    back to vanilla. The correct invariant — like DoorRando's start-frontier
    guard — is that shuffling transports never makes reachability WORSE than the
    vanilla baseline.

    Besides pickups, every vanilla-reachable TRANSPORT ENDPOINT room must stay
    reachable. This matters since the Itorash capsule rides re-entered the pool:
    Itorash holds zero pickups (the pickup criterion alone can't see it) but the
    victory sweep needs it, so a matching that strands an endpoint-only room
    would surface only as a FillError at generation. Rejecting the roll here
