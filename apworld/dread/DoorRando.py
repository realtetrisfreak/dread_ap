"""Per-seed door-lock weakness assignment (door rando) for the native graph.

Randovania-style: each rando-eligible door (its vanilla weakness is in the logic
DB's ``door_rando.change_from``) is reassigned a weakness from ``change_to``.
Doors are TWO-SIDED — one engine actor with a shield on each side — so the paired
sides always receive the SAME weakness (a "two-way" door, mirroring Randovania's
``force_change_two_way``). That INCLUDES asymmetric doors whose far side is not
itself eligible (the free "Open Passage" back of a one-way sensor door, or the
"Access Locked"/"Access Closed" back of a one-way grey door): the extractor
emits a COMPANION dock side for them (``companion: true`` + ``vanilla_ast``),
grouped with the eligible side, because the physical patch replaces the whole
two-sided actor — a rolled weakness gates BOTH directions in-game, and RDV's
post-fill sync assigns the paired node the same weakness even when ineligible.
The assignment feeds two consumers:

  * logic — ``graph_logic.build_regions`` resolves each dock atom against the
    assignment, so AP's live region sweep re-derives reachability for THIS seed
    (the whole reason for the native graph). Fill therefore only ever places
    items in spots reachable through the randomized doors — solvability is by
    construction.
  * patcher — ``assignments_to_door_patches`` emits ``door_patches``
    ({scenario, actor, door_type}) for open-dread-rando, one per physical door.

v1 excludes the ``locked`` weakness (Access Permanently Closed) from the pool so
every door stays passable with the right weapon and the door graph stays
connected (the goal can't be walled off). Per-door ``incompatible_weaknesses``
(from the logic DB) are honored.

TWO SAFETY BOUNDS on the pool (both learned from a hardware crash — a guest-side
null deref in the game when *traversing* a randomized door):

  * **Type restriction** — only the "basic" door types open-dread-rando renders
    robustly (``BASIC_DOOR_TYPES``, the set its own everything-patched fixture
    exercises) are eligible. The exotic shields it offers but never stress-tests
    (bomb / cross-bomb / power-bomb, ice / storm missile, diffusion) are dropped:
    they pull multiple shield-asset folders into a scenario, and a missing asset
    loads a null shield actor that the game dereferences on the door transition.
  * **Per-scenario shield budget** — open-dread-rando allots
    ``SHIELD_IDS_PER_SCENARIO`` shield-actor ids per scenario, *shared* with the
    vanilla shields it renames into that same pool up front. Each shielded door
    costs 2 ids; converting too many unshielded doors to shielded types exhausts
    the pool (``IndexError`` at patch time). The roll seeds each scenario with
    its baked vanilla baseline (``door_rando.vanilla_shield_ids``) and refuses
    shielded targets once a scenario nears the cap.

START-DOOR GUARD (the thing that makes fill succeed): AP's stock
``fill_restrictive`` needs a non-empty EARLY-reachable pickup set to bootstrap
progression. If the doors reachable from spawn with only the starting kit are
randomized to hard types, the early sphere is empty and fill dead-ends. So the
doors reachable from the start with the starting items (vanilla) are PROTECTED
(kept vanilla); only doors past that early frontier are randomized. Verified:
with the guard, 0/15 seeds fail; without it, ~all fail. The guard touches ~38 of
457 doors. See [[dread-native-graph-spike]].

Refinement: a door the starting kit CANNOT open from either side (vanilla) is
exempt from protection even when it touches the early frontier — it is not an
early-sphere edge, so keeping it vanilla can't help fill, and randomizing it
can only ever ADD early reachability. Without the exemption, a double-sided
Sensor Lock door adjacent to the spawn area stayed a sensor door for the whole
seed even when the player listed "Sensor Lock Door" in ``doors_to_change``
(reported on the door outside Corpius).
