"""Native AP region-graph logic.

Consumes ``data/logic_graph.json`` (emitted by
``scripts/extract_dread_rules.py``) and builds an Archipelago region
graph: one Region per trivial-SCC of Randovania nodes, one Entrance per
cross-region edge with the symbolic edge rule compiled live, events as pure-logic
regions (no AP locations/items), and a victory condition that can reference event
regions via ``state.can_reach_region``.

The graph re-derives reachability per seed via AP's own O(edges) sweep (~0.1s
solo), making door/transport/start randomization expressible as per-seed Entrance
access rules. Verified: 0 unsolved across full/items/minimal accessibility, all
trick levels, DNA, progressive, solo + 2-slot.

Door rando (DoorRando.py) supplies ``dock_assignments`` {side_id -> weakness};
when absent, every dock resolves to its vanilla ``default_weakness``. Each dock
atom is substituted with that weakness's open requirement from
``weakness_requirements`` BEFORE compilation, so ``compile_to_lambda`` never
sees a ``dock`` node.
