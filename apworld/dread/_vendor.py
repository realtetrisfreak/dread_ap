"""Locate the vendored ``open-dread-rando`` source for the patcher subprocess.

The patcher source ships in three forms depending on how the apworld was
deployed; this module is the single resolver for "where does
``import open_dread_rando`` find its source":

1. **Source tree (dev)** — pinned git submodule at
   ``<repo>/vendor/open-dread-rando/src/open_dread_rando/``.
2. **Folder install** — ``scripts/install_apworld.py --mode folder`` copies the
   patcher into ``<apworld>/_vendored_patcher/open_dread_rando/`` next to the
   apworld files.
3. **Zip install (.apworld)** — same layout as folder install, but inside the
   zip. We extract the bundled tree to a per-zip-mtime cache directory under
   the user's home cache the first time it's needed (the patcher subprocess
   cannot ``-m`` a module that lives inside a zip path).

The patcher subprocess receives ``PYTHONPATH`` pointed at the directory we
return, so its plain ``import open_dread_rando`` resolves to the bundled
copy with no ``pip install`` step.

Runtime dependencies of open-dread-rando (``mercury-engine-data-structures``,
``jsonschema``, ``json-delta``, ``open-dread-rando-exlaunch``) are still pip
packages and must be installed in the target Python. The wizard installs them.

If none of the three sources are present — the user is running from a clone
with no submodule init AND the apworld was assembled without the bundling
step — :func:`vendored_open_dread_rando_src` returns ``None``.
