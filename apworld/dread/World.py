"""DreadWorld — the AP World subclass.

Registers items / locations / regions, creates one ``DreadItem`` per
item-pool entry, and writes a small slot_data so the client can derive
its mapping at connect time.

Logic uses the native AP region-graph (``graph_logic.py`` +
``data/logic_graph.json``): one Region per trivial-SCC of Randovania
nodes, events as pure-logic regions, per-seed dock/transport assignment.
See ``graph_logic.py`` and ``scripts/extract_dread_rules.py``.

Progressive items (Randovania's Progressive Suit/Spin/Charge Beam/Beam/Missile/
Bomb) are exposed as six opt-out-by-default toggles. When a group is enabled its
tier items leave the findable pool and one "Progressive X" item (one copy per
tier) takes their place; collect/remove credit the k-th copy onto the k-th tier
in state so ``state.has("Wave Beam")`` etc. still works.
Delivery sends the full multi-stage progression with the first tier's class and
the game grants the next missing tier (see client/protocol.py + Options.py).

Skipped for now (later phases):
  * Hint distribution; door/elevator randomization.
  * Ammo / damage / E-tank counting (v0.3).

        open-dread-rando's ``patch_credits`` renders the patcher input's
        ``spoiler_log`` (item name → location description) as a "Major Item
        Locations" section after the randomizer credits — shown only once the
        run is beaten, so real spoilers are appropriate (Randovania does the
        same). The starter preset template bakes Randovania's own example
        placements there, false for any AP seed; this replaces them with where
        this slot's majors actually landed.

        Majors mirror the template's curation: the unique single-copy
        abilities, the Progressive group items, and the placed Metroid DNA —
        tanks/ammo/chain upgrades are excluded. Multi-copy items (progressives)
        newline-join their locations, matching the template's format. A major
        in another slot's world renders as "<player>'s <location>". Precollected
        starters aren't placed anywhere, so they simply don't appear.
